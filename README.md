### Introduction
A synthetic time-series datasets has created with the given trend and seasonality parameters. Bi-directional __LSTM__ neural network is used to predict the signal. 

### How to create project environment and install packages:

1. install packages
```bash
conda env update -n <yourenvname> --file environment.yaml
```
Some packages have pip dependency. In this case, use  pip to install the packages.
```bash
pip install <package name>
```
## RUN the App
To run the app, Go to __FRONEND__ folder and shoot this command:              
```bash
streamlit run LSTMTimeseries.py
```
## From Web UI 

 - upload image
 
 - click the **Detect Object** button to detect the object
